A web application for finding out your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) the _right_ way by logging the calories you consume over time and adjusting accordingly. This is not a traditional TDEE calculator, it finds _your_ TDEE.  

Inspired by the spreadsheet created by [2_Suns](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/3bx3rl/a_tool_i_made_to_help_find_your_actual_tdee_and/).

## Getting Started

    npm install
